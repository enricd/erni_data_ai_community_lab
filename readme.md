### ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§    

<br>

This is an Open Source collaborative project from the [ERNI](https://betterask.erni) Data and AI Community to share ideas and knowledge about Data/AI interesting topics, by building Streamlit apps in this website.

### **Do you want to contribute?**

If you are from the ERNI Data and AI Community and you want to be a regular Contributor to this project, request Contributor access to this repository to Enric Domingo (edomingodomenech@gmail.com), then:

1. Clone the repository in your computer
      
        - with HTTPS: $ git clone https://github.com/enricd/erni_data_ai_community_lab.git  

        - with SSH: $ git clone git@github.com:enricd/erni_data_ai_community_lab.git  
    
2. Checkout to the `dev` branch:   
      
        - $ git checkout dev  
    
3. Create a new branch with your name and the topic you want to work on, for example: `John-Cats-vs-Dogs-Classifier`
    
4. Create a new folder under `projects/`  for your project, for example: `projects/john-cats-vs-dogs-classifier/`. Here you will be able to develop your app functions, utils, store images, light models and light datasets, etc.
    
5. Create a new python file for your Streamlit app, for example: `pages/4-john-cats-vs-dogs-classifier.py`. This will be the entry point for your app, you can define the layout and main parts of your app in this file.
    
6. At any moment you can test your app by running the Streamlit server locally:
    
        - $ streamlit run ðŸ§ª_Home.py 

        (you need to be in the root folder of the project: 
        path/to/the/project/erni_data_ai_community_lab/)

Otherwise, if you only plan to do small changes or corrections/updates to some of the apps, you can collaborate by opening a Pull Request to the `dev` branch. To do it the steps are very similar as before: Fork the repo from the `dev` branch, do any change, push it to your github forked repo and start a PR. 

Everyone is welcome to contribute!! ðŸ¤—

You can find more info, documentation and tutorials about Streamlit in the [Streamlit official website](https://streamlit.io/) and on the [Streamlit YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@streamlitofficial).
